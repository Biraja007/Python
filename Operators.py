#   Operator is an action performed between two operands.
#They are of 4 types:Assignment,Arithmetic,Logical,Relational/Coparision.
#Assignment operator is used to assign values & denoted by "=" .
a = 99

#Arithmetic operators are +,-,*,/
#Addition (+):Returns Sum
print (2+3)
#Subtraction (-):Returns difference
print (5-2)
#Division(/):Returns quotient
print (10/2)
#Multiplication (*):Returns product
print (2*3)
#Modulo(%):Returns remainder
print (10%3)

#Relational/Comparision operators are ==,>,<,<=,>=,!=
#Equal to (==):Returns true is both LHS=RHS
print (2==2)
#Greater than (>):Returns true if operand1 is greater than operand2
print (5>2)
#Lesser than (<):Returns true if operand1 is lesser than operand2
print (5<8)
#Greater than or equal to (>=):Returns true if operand1 is greater than or equal to operand2
print (5>=1)
#\#Lesser than or equal to (<=):Returns true if operand1 is lesser than or equal to operand2
print (2<=5)
#Not equal to (!=):Returns true is LHS & RHS are not same
print (2!=5)

#Logical operators are and,or,#
#and:Returns true only if both operands are true
print ((5>3) and (3<7))
#or:Returns true if atleast any any one is true
print ((5<3) or (3<5))
#not:Reverses the boolean value of the operand
print (not (5<3))
